# Australis-like-tabs-proton-changes-FF
Changes to make the new proton UI redesign in Firefox better; including changes to tabs, compact mode, proton gradient accents in elements and much more. All testing done in latest nightly versions with Proton enabled.

Works best with default dark theme and alpenglow theme. Compact mode enabled of course lol.
