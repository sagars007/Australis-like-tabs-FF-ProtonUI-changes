# Australis-like-tabs-proton-changes-FF
Changes to make the new proton UI redesign in Firefox better; including changes to tabs, compact mode, proton gradient accents in elements, bookmarks-bar-appear-on-hover and much more. All testing done in latest nightly versions with Proton enabled.

Works best with default dark theme and alpenglow theme. Compact mode enabled of course lol.

_Stuff that don't work properly (hopefully will be fixed):_
1. Container tab indicators
2. Selected tab gradient indicator - doesn't cover entire tab outline, only top part.
3. Tabs lose its shape when tab scrollbox enlarges in size due to many open tabs(approx 15+ tabs)
